Task Name: Simple Network Sniffer

Objective:
Create a basic network sniffer in Python to capture and monitor network traffic.


Purpose:

Gain insight into the flow of data in a network.

I'd like you to please understand the structure and transmission of network packets.

Create a simple tool that listens to network traffic and pulls out relevant information (IP addresses, protocols, ports, etc.).


Key Requirements:

Raw capture of network packets from a network interface.

Parse and print significant data from the packets (source IP, destination IP, protocol type, etc.).

Utilize Python libraries such as socket (for raw packet sniffing) or scapy (for simpler parsing and packet manipulation).

Provide basic analysis, such as packet count and protocol statistics, or determine the most active IP addresses.


Skills You Will Learn:

Socket programming.

Packet formats (Ethernet frame, IP packet, TCP/UDP segment, etc.).

Data parsing and basic analysis.

Tools Recommended:

Python 3.x

Libraries: socket, scapy, struct, etc.
